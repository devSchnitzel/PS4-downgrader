# PS4-downgrader
This Project it just a try to downgrade the ps4 
the rar file it the fake server you can put any pup file to make the ps4 download it and install it (keep in your mind it just a try for downgrade the ps4 ) 
note :  dont use proxy to change the ps4 real server to the fake one this will not working 
usage ::::::
you must use dns spoofing when the ps4 want to update so you can redirect all the traffic to your fake server I use PARROT OS 
you must have ettercap or any dns spoofing to use this method 
in dns.txt you will get some dns serveres which the ps4 using it ,we want to redirict the ps4 when the ps4 try to update 
so this list you must edit the /etc/ettercap/etter.dns and add it this may help you to do  that https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/tutorial-dns-spoofing-0167796/
the update file you must put it in the main page in the webserver to make the ps4 access it 
you must edit somethings in ps4-updatelist.xml such as the size of pup file and verision of it 
you must edit somethigs in \update\ps4\image\2018_0510 you will see to files you must put the pup file in the tow files 
now every thing OK 
1- fake server is running 
2- dns spoffing running 
now just when you click update on the ps4 all the orders will be redirect to the fake server and the ps4 will download your pup file 
I test it on 5.50 and I can install from the fake server 5.53 without the usb 
I test it on 5.50 with 5.05 pup file on the fake server and I get erorr say's the server is have some problem but when I change the info in xml file for 5.53 but the pup file is still 5.05 I get erorr say's that pup file can't used for this ps4
